# Chiara Bianchi | Product Designer Portfolio

This project is a responsive portfolio website for Chiara Bianchi, a product designer. It demonstrates modern HTML, SCSS, and CSS techniques, including BEM naming, mixins, and accessibility best practices.

## Features

- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile
- BEM methodology for class naming
- SCSS with mixins and variables for maintainable styles
- Accessibility improvements (alt text, semantic HTML)
- Organized sections: Profile, Quotes, Contact Info, Socials, Languages, Projects, Experience, Education, Skills, Tools

## Structure

- `index.html` — Main HTML file for the portfolio
- `scss/main.scss` — Main SCSS source file (edit this for styles)
- `css/main.css` — Compiled CSS (do not edit directly)
- `assets/` — Images and icons used in the site

## Getting Started

1. **Install a SCSS compiler** (e.g., [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/install)).
2. **Compile SCSS to CSS**:
   ```bash
   sass scss/main.scss css/main.css
   ```
3. **Open `index.html` in your browser** to view the site.

## Customization

- Update images in the `assets/` folder as needed.
- Edit `scss/main.scss` for style changes.
- Update `index.html` for content changes.

## Accessibility
